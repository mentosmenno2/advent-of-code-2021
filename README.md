# Advent Of Code 2021

I'm attempting to solve puzzles from advent of code 2021.

https://adventofcode.com/2021

I use the PHP language for solving these puzzles.

Every folder within the `answers` folder, represents the day number of the puzzle.
Inside every day folder, there will be a separation between part 1 and part 2 of the puzzle.
